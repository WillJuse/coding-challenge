<td>
  <a href="" ng-click="update()">{{ref.name}}</a>
</td>
<!--
Ideally, this would contain all the rows for the table, which would make it
more easily extendable and keep all the code in the directive, but something
breaks when putting that td in here and everything goes haywire. Another
way around it would be to use some sort of Angular grid...but time is a thing.
